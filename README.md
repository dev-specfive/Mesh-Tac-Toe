Mesh-Tac-Toe is the world's first game built for the open Meshtastic network! If you're familiar with Tic-Tac-Toe, then you're already halfway there. This app isn't just about the game; it's a showcase of the potential of low-bandwidth, long-range communications provided by LoRA technology for more entertaining uses than just texting.

### üéÆ About Mesh-Tac-Toe
At [SpecFive](https://specfive.com), we're committed to making mesh networks more practical, fun, and usable. Mesh-Tac-Toe is our first small step in this direction. The game leverages the Meshtastic network to demonstrate how even simple games can benefit from mesh networking technology.

While the idea, game logic, and user interface are our contributions, we owe a debt of gratitude to the [Meshtastic app](https://meshtastic.org/) available under GPL, which allowed us to integrate protocol connectivity and associated tasks seamlessly. To give back to the community, we're also making Mesh-Tac-Toe available under the GPL license.

- **Play Tic-Tac-Toe:** Enjoy the classic game over the Meshtastic network.
- **Low-Bandwidth Communication:** Experience the power of LoRA technology for fun, beyond just texting.
