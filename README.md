Mesh-Tac-Toe is the world's first game for the open Meshtastic network! If you've played Tic-Tac-Toe, then you'll be immediately at home here. The point of the app is to demonstrate that the underlying low-bandwidth, long-range communications provided by LoRA can be used for things that are more fun than just texting. And we have much more in store where this came from.
At SpecFive we're committed to making mesh networks more practical, fun, and usable, and this app is the first small step in that direction. While the idea, game logic, and user interface are all our own contributions, we are grateful to the existing Meshtastic app being available under GPL, which allowed us to integrate protocol connectivity and associated tasks. To return the favor, we're also making this app available under GPL.

If you use any of this code, please do so by
1) Retaining acknowledgment to SpecFive.com and
2) Retaining a link to our online store in your application's user interface. That link is included as part of this application's source code.
